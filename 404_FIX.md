# ✅ 404 Error - FIXED!

## Problem
You were seeing a 404 "This page could not be found" error on localhost:3001.

## Root Cause
**Multiple `npm run dev` processes** were running simultaneously (3 instances!), causing port conflicts and routing issues:
- Process 1: Running for 56 minutes
- Process 2: Running for 35 minutes  
- Process 3: Running for 30 minutes

Additionally, there was a broken empty page file at `[id]/export/page.tsx` that was preventing compilation.

## Solution
1. ✅ Stopped all conflicting Node.js processes
2. ✅ Deleted the `.next` build cache to clear any corrupted build files
3. ✅ Removed the problematic `[id]` directory with empty files
4. ✅ Started a fresh development server

## ✨ Current Status

**Frontend is now running on: http://localhost:3004**

The port changed because 3000, 3001, 3002, and 3003 were all occupied by previous instances.

## 🚀 Access Your Application

Open your browser and visit: **http://localhost:3004**

You should now see the beautiful, styled WBS Generator home page!
